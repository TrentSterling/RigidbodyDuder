# RigidbodyDuder
This is a simple rigidbody FPS/3rd person movement project for Unity.

The rigidbody player character is moved using ONLY ADDFORCE! This makes sure that interpolation works, and it also allows for other stuff like explosions, to add cumulative force!

There is also an orbit camera.
